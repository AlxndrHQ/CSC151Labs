CSC 151 Labs

This will be a collection of all of the labs, projects, and classes that I was given during CSC151.

In this repo I will be recompleting all of my old assignments.

This is an ice cream stand, in the next iteration I will use the ice cream class to create user defined methods to set and retrieve the values pertaining to the ice cream stand. 

I will add each order to a stack, and ask the user if they would like to create another order.
