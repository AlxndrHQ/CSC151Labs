CSC 151 Labs

This will be a collection of all of the labs, projects, and classes that I was given during CSC151.

In this repo I will be recompleting all of my old assignments.

## IceCreamDriver2

This is the continuation of the ice cream stand.
I will use the IceCream class to create user defined methods to set and retrieve the values pertaining to the ice cream stand driver.

- instantiate an object from the iceCream class to store the customers data
- use user defined setter and getter methods to set and retrieve the data to the respective class
- store each input based on what the user has entered (Ex. setFlavor)
- add each order to a stack.
- at the end, ask if the user would like to place another order

Goal:

- user will input a bill, if insuffient they will be prompted to add the remaining balance (only 1, 5, 10, 20)
    the additional bills will be added to their tender
    subtract their tender from their bill, then return amount of change

To Do:

  -  needs to create object for this order
  - needs to print order object from stack
  - (Completed) the flavor needs to work for the string or the number value
    

## WilliamsJrS_P3

This is an ice cream stand, in the next iteration I will use the ice cream class to create user defined methods to set and retrieve the values pertaining to the ice cream stand.

I will add each order to a stack, and ask the user if they would like to create another order.
