CSC 151 Labs

This will be a collection of all of the labs, projects, and classes that I was given during CSC151.

In this repo I will be recompleting all of my old assignments.

## IceCreamDriver

This is the continuation of the ice cream stand.
I will use the IceCream class to create user defined methods to set and retrieve the values pertaining to the ice cream stand driver.

- instantiate an object from the iceCream class to store the customers data
- use user defined setter and getter methods to set and retrieve the data to the respective class
- store each input based on what the user has entered (Ex. setFlavor)
- add each order to a stack.
- at the end, ask if the user would like to place another order

## WilliamsJrS_P3

This is an ice cream stand, in the next iteration I will use the ice cream class to create user defined methods to set and retrieve the values pertaining to the ice cream stand.

I will add each order to a stack, and ask the user if they would like to create another order.
