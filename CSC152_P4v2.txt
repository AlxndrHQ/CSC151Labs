1) You will ask a user to type in names, "DONE" (ignore case) to stop the input
2) As the user enter names and those will to be added to a stack and a queue, except "DONE"
3) Then as you removing an element out one from stack and one from queue, you will compare if the value is the same (ignore case).
==>> If NOT, then that sequential of names are not palindrome
==>> once you remove all items from stack and queue, they the same, then sequential
is a palindrome.
4) allow the user to repeat the process, and they can enter Yes, No, Y or N only (other
input, as to reenter, and ignore case)

================== Example Input / Output 
Welcome to YOUR FULL NAME Palindrome Check
Please enter names ("DONE" to stop): FUN SUN FUN STOP
FUN SUN FUN -- This is a palindrome
You want to check another sequence? (Yes or No): Yes

Please enter names ("DONE" to stop): SARA JAME TIM STOP
SARA JAME TIM -- This is a NOT palindrome
You want to check another sequence? (Yes or No): N
You have run 2 tests: 1 is palindrome and 1 is NOT palindrome.
Thank you for checking out the system.
